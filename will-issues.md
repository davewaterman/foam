# Will Issues

This is a record of run-ins with Will Jackson on [[FMRD]]. I started keeping track in August after half a year or so of dealing with this, so the earlier encounters are not as well documented.

(Date: YR-MO-DA)

1. 20-08-08 He rearranged the pages in the Engineering Meeting minutes section of confluence without asking me, saying he "got tired of seeing a long list". I asked him to check with me before making structural changes to a page I moderate.
2. 20-08-12 I spoke with Johnny who revealed that the Will issue is front and center for him. Others on the team have voiced concerns as well. He is coaching Will on better working interpersonally with others. He seems triggered by small things. Johnny is considering if he could replace Will on the project with someone who would not have a negative impact on the project.

His principles / issues:

1. He says "it's good to get better"... but it's **his opinions** about what's better. It's not necessarily true, and he ignores the opinions of others about what's "better" when he acts unilaterally or dismissively.
2. He does not stay in his swim-lane of "devops". It'd be helpful to establish what he owns and dosn't own.
