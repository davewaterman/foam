# Note Taking

My notes historically have been hierarchical. I developed an outline-style technique through my experience in education and applied it in work and my personal endeavors. It's good for reference, but not really discovery or visualization.

I'm excited to try networked thoughts!

My [[memory]] isn't the best, and I've been meaning to write more. My motivations are:

- better recall and associate information with other information I've learned in the past.
- better keep stories
- invent something of use one day
- provide a better space for note taking at work ([[fmrd]]) and in personal life endeavors.

The FOAM markdown extension has [these shortcuts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)

[[mom]] is interested in hearing how the networked note taking approach works.
