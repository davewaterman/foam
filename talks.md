How can I deal with disagreements in my romantic relationships better? Seems like a recurring theme that when my boyfriends and I disconnect, they take issue with how I handle it. This was the case with John and is the case now with [[Sean]]

One thing that can help with arguments is [[memory]] about what has happened in the past. Note taking could help recall the stories.
