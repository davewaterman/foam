# Sean

Sean is my boyfriend. He has a great [[memory]]. Maybe he should try networked [[note-taking]].

We have [[arguments]] sometimes. He's sensitive and takes things personally. I have trouble with that. When he points out things he thinks I did wrong and I disagree, I defend myself. He doesn't like that. He wants me to ???.
