# Structured Information

My [[memory]] for unstructured information is sub-par, but it's quite good for structure inforation. Using an outline for [[note-taking]] has proven very helpful for adding strcuture to information so that I am better able to retain and use it.

Information is not naturally structured in an outline format, though. The complex relationships among concepts cannot be bound to hierarchy in all circumstances.

Networked notes peaks my interest since it basically embraces a graph approach to structuring information that more closely emulates the connections

[memory]: memory "Memory"
[note-taking]: note-taking "Note Taking"
