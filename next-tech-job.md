# Next Tech Job

I've been at [[BAH]] since January 2013, 7.5 years at the time of writing. Before long, I feel like i'll just end up staying around forever. What's next?

- Big tech company
  - Amazon
  - Google
  - Apple
  - Facebook
- Small tech company / start-up
- My own business idea
  - Would probably make most sense to stay at BAH and work something part time
  - Not ideal yet. I'd benefit from the experience at a large / successful tech company first.
  - Could do it from my ideas for [[apps]]

For big tech, pre-requisites:

- [[Algorithms]]
- Contacts
